# MEAN Scaffold

This is the scaffolding for a lightweight MEAN app, with testing frameworks and a gruntfile set up.

## Installation

I'm assuming you have Node.js and MongoDB installed, with Mongo running in the background.

- Clone this repo - `git clone git@github.com:harrim91/MEAN_scaffold.git`
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- To run the app - `grunt`
- To run tests - `grunt test` (this will run mocha, karma and protractor tests)
